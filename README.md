# General Tree: Calculate Tree Height
Course URL: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/

__Assignment Description:__
<br />
<br />
Task: You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall
that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a
leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.
<br />
<br />
Input Format: The first line contains the number of nodes 𝑛. The second line contains 𝑛 integer numbers
from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of nodes. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, node 𝑖 is the root,
otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th node. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root.
It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.
<br />
<br />
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105.
<br />
<br />
Output Format: Output the height of the tree.
